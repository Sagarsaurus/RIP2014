This requires python 2.7 or above.  The obstacle variable contains a list of Obstacle class variables (see util.py) that the algorithm must find a path around.  There exists a start and goal tuple.  These are given to the algorithm which in turn attempts to find the path.  The path is then plotted on the proper background image representing the objects.  To run simply run python3 fieldNavigation.py
