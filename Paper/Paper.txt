Question 1
Part a: Compare the Features of the Two Planners

Blackbox Planner
	This planner operated by turning the given problem into a set of boolean 
satisfiability problems through two mechanisms. The front end is a graphplan technique
 where instead of state nodes and edges representing possible traversal, we have nodes of 
actions/facts and edges from facts -> actions or from actions -> facts affected by said 
action. Arranged in an alternating fashion: Facts, to possible actions, back to facts. 
It also uses backward chaining and iterative depth probing to keep from exploring too 
many extraneous nodes.

VHPOP
	VHPOP is a partial-order planner. This means it generates a lists of actions 
necessary to get to the goal, only constraining their order when absolutely necessary 
(One has preconditions, an earlier action must synthesize) It operates on a system of 
clever heuristics, and evaluating dead end states.

Part b: Which Planner was Fastest
	Both took very little time, as this is a relatively small problem in terms of search
 space, but  the Blackbox planner was still undoubtedly faster at 12 milliseconds versus 
the 5160 milliseconds of the VHPOP planner. 

Part c: Why Might this Planner be Faster
